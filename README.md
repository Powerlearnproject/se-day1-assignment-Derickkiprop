#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a discipline that involves the application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software. It is a systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approach to creating software that meets specified requirements, ensuring the software is reliable, efficient, and maintainable over time.
Importance in the Technology Industry:
i) Software engineering ensures that software is of high quality, which is crucial in an industry where reliability, security, and performance are paramount.
ii) By applying engineering principles, software engineering helps in reducing development costs and time. Proper planning, design, and testing can prevent costly mistakes and rework.
iii) With the rise of cyber threats, software engineering plays a critical role in ensuring that software is secure and can protect sensitive data.
iv) Software engineering often involves collaboration between various disciplines, including computer science, project management, and human-computer interaction, fostering innovation and creating well-rounded solutions.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
i)The Birth of Structured Programming: Structured programming emerged as a solution to the challenges of "spaghetti code"—complex and tangled code that was difficult to understand, debug, and maintain.
ii) The Emergence of Object-Oriented Programming: Object-oriented programming (OOP) was a paradigm shift in software development that focused on modeling software as a collection of "objects" that represent real-world entities.
iii) The Advent of Agile Methodologies: Agile methodologies emerged as a response to the limitations of traditional, rigid software development approaches like the Waterfall model.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Planning-This phase involves gathering initial requirements, setting project goals, defining the scope, estimating resources, and identifying potential risks.
2. Requirements Analysis-During this phase, detailed requirements are gathered and documented.
3. Design-In this phase, the software’s architecture and design are developed.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a traditional, linear approach where each phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) must be completed before the next begins. The process flows in one direction, much like a waterfall whereas agile is a flexible, iterative approach where the project is divided into small, manageable units called sprints or iterations, usually lasting 1-4 weeks. Each sprint results in a potentially shippable product increment.
i) Agile can easily adapt to changes in requirements, making it ideal for projects where the scope may evolve over time while Waterfall is not well-suited for projects where requirements are likely to change, as it’s difficult to go back to a previous phase.
ii) Agile allows for continuous delivery of working software, providing value to stakeholders throughout the development process while Waterfall since all phases must be completed before the software is delivered, the time to market can be slower.
-Waterfall works well for large, complex projects where the deliverables and objectives are clear from the start, such as building infrastructure software.
-Agile works well in fast-paced industries like tech startups, where speed to market and adaptability are crucial .

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
